 Mayra Sierra is the facilitator of StoryCorps. StoryCorps is an independent nonprofit whose mission is to provide people of all backgrounds and beliefs with the opportunity to record, share, and preserve the stories of our lives. Since 2003, StoryCorps has collected and archived more than 45,000 interviews with nearly 90,000 participants. Each conversation is recorded on a free CD to share, and is preserved at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. StoryCorps is one of the largest oral history projects of its kind, and millions listen to our weekly broadcasts on NPR’s Morning Edition and on the Listen pages.

 During my study abroad to Berlin I met the most wonderful, eclectic people. But no one took my full interest like Sophie. Sophie Fullard is 27 years old and says “I don’t look a day older than 21.” She is a new Berliner from London who left her nine to five job back home in exchange for a bicycle and a pair of roller skates. Fullard describes her life as a “dream come true” in Berlin and she can not picture herself living the rest of her life in any other place. Berlin is Fullard’s new home and helps other travelers notice the “beauty yet innocence” that is seen in the tours that she leads in Fat Tire.

 "Milcho was Born March 16, 1972 in Clichy, France from a Salvadorian Mother, Spanish father & a long line of one filmmaker in her family, (70's Salvadorian Cinematographer Baltazar Polio 1949-1989) causing no change in the planet's atmosphere, its politics nor in its ozone layer. As a matter a fact, only eventful for a handful of people."
